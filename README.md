# Project 1: Recognizing Textual Entailment

## Description
For Project-1, you will implement a deep learning model that recognizes the textual entailment relation between two sentences.
Here, we are given two sentences: the premise, denoted by the letter t and the hypothesis, denoted by the letter h. We say
that the premise entails the hypothesis (i.e. t &#8594; h if the meaning of h can be inferred from the meaning of t). 

The task of textual entailment is set up as a binary classication problem where, given the premise and the hypothesis, the
goal is to classify the relation between them as _Entails_ or _Not Entails_.
